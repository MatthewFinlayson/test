One way to remain vigilant of potential shifts in the algorithm is through a tool Moz has created. This tool is called **MozCast** and it provides a report showing turbulence in the algorithm over a period of time. Turbulence is measured by studying ranking fluctuations. Days which are higher in temperature have a higher percentage of ranking fluctuations, meaning that more people have experienced significant changes. This may hint that an algorithm update has been pushed out.

One way to stay on top of any relevant updates is to set up [**Google Alerts**](https://www.google.com/alerts) for topics of interest. You can even do this with your own name and brand to quickly respond to online mentions.

We’re always recycling content. But what makes it unique and worth reading is our **own perspective.**

Create helpful, reliable, people-first content.

Capitalize on Your Own Experiences, Studies, and Data. If your experiences are detailed, useful, and thorough enough, you’re likely to have other people reference them and include a citation back to your website.

**Diversify with Multimedia Content.**

Screenshots. Photos. Infographics. Charts. Videos. Gifs.

Google has deemed **Core Web Vitals** as what they call **real-world experience metrics**.

Y.M.Y.L = Your Money, Your Life

Any page including content that can affect someone's health, happiness, safety, or financial stability is considered a Y-M-Y-L page. Any site simply offering advice around these topics can be viewed through the lens of YMYL.

E.A.T = Expertise, Authority, Trust

To determine how trustworthy your site is in the YMYL category, Google will evaluate your site on its E.A.T score.

**Featured snippets** are a video or article that Google displays at the very top of organic search results. This is often called position zero and it aims to answer a user's query right away. These snippets are often also the answer for related voice search questions on voice-assisted devices like Google Home.

The best way to rank for a lot of featured snippets is simply to produce a lot of great content that will address what people are searching for.

#howto #featuredsnippet **How to get a Featured Snippet**

1. To start your featured snippet optimizations, you’ll want to look for a place in your content to add a “**What is keyword**" heading tag. This signals to Google that your upcoming text could be helpful as a featured snippet.
    
    **What** is Agile methodology?
    
2. **When optimizing for the featured snippet, it’s important to include an “is” statement.
    
    The first sentence should start with the structure: “**Keyword** is…”
    
    Agile methodology **is** a type of project management process, mainly used for software development…
    
3. **Fully define the topic in 2-3 sentences.
    
    - The first sentence should define the topic.
    - The second and third sentences should describe 2-3 must-know facts about the topic.
    - Avoid using any extraneous phrasing in your definition.
    
4. **Match the current featured snippet format.
    
    The different types of featured snippets include:
    
    - Paragraphs (most common).
    - Bulleted and numbered lists.
    - Tables (least common).

This rule is simple. Whatever featured snippet type you see on the SERP, match that type in your content.

5. Never use your brand name in featured snippet text.
6. Don’t use first-person language.

Keyword Basics

**Semantic keyword relationship:** Using words related to and sometimes synonymous with our focus keyword will help the page be seen as more relevant for the focus keyword or the topic is trying to rank for.

**Long-tail keywords** are longer keywords or phrases that are more difficult to predict but are often very targeted. For example, a long-tail keyword might be, where can I learn how to make wine?

**Keyword anatomy** can be broken down into three main elements:

**head | modifier | tail**

example: restaurant | discount | online

A keyword where these three elements – head | modifier | tail – are used is often referred to as a long tail keyword.

It’s worth mentioning that the order of the language is not important. The head, modifier and tail of a keyword are named according to their properties, not according to the order in the keyword they occur in.

**The head:** Restaurant is the head of the keyword, this is the focal point of the user’s search and what the rest of the keyword relates to. Whether the user searches for _restaurant discount online_ or _luxury restaurant_ we know they’re searching for a restaurant.

**The modifier:** This is a term which can be interchanged with other words in order to change a single aspect of the keyword's meaning. Unlike the head of the keyword it will not alter the type of the search.

Typical keyword modifiers are things like:

- locations
- brands
- styles

**The tail:** This part of the keyword clarifies or adds further detail to the head term yet it doesn’t fundamentally change the searcher’s intent. In our restaurant discount online example, the use of _online_ suggests that the searcher is looking for discount codes that can be found online.

The buying cycle: Research, Refine, Research

**The research phase** is going to be the stage in the buying cycle that uses the broadest terms. Being broad, like holiday they will get lots of traffic. That’s great, lots of people are searching for that term. However people searching with that term won’t be at the point where they are ready to buy, so they will be low converting.

- holiday

**The refining stage** is where people are refining their choices; looking for something more exact. So rather than looking for a specific product they are likely to be using keywords which could relate to a group of products.

- _half board holidays_
- _all inclusive holidays_
- _self catering holidays_

**The buying phase** the customer has decided exactly it is what they want. They are now searching for a specific product or service. This of course ties into your product level pages, where you show a single product which you are selling. As these are tied to a specific product the keywords are more exact. They are long tail keywords.

- _all inclusive holidays in alicante_
- _barbados self-catering holidays_
- _half board holidays in the UK_

Make content for what your users will ask questions about

---

Use google trends to help build persona.

In marketing, personas are split into **two major groups.**

**The potential buyer** is made up of people who are probably not aware your product or service exists or they've been exposed to it briefly in the past but haven't became customers. These people have a problem **that they're searching for and need to figure out a solution.**

**The existing customer** is made up of people who currently shop with you or use your service. It's important to understand that these consumers are already your customers and they already enjoy what you offer. So you want to know what they like best and also areas that they think you can improve upon so you can not only create content that better engages and retains them but also potentially create more products or services that they'll use.
